## Technical Details

### Architecture
- Node.js 18+ with ES modules
- Unified application architecture:
  - Single process (app.js) - combines Archipelago connection, chat integration, and admin API
  - Integrated admin server with hot restart capability
  - Config unpacker system for standalone executable environments
- Single Executable Application (SEA) support via Node.js experimental SEA feature
- Standalone executable build system with esbuild bundling

### Dependencies
- `archipelago.js` v2.0.4 - Archipelago protocol client
- `@streamerbot/client` v1.12.2 - Streamer.bot WebSocket client
- `express` v4.18.2 - Admin API server
- `ws` v8.18.0 - WebSocket support
- `multer` v2.0.2 - File upload handling
- `cors` v2.8.5 - Cross-origin resource sharing
- `yaml` v2.3.4 - YAML parsing
- `busboy` v1.6.0 - HTTP POST parsing
- `decompress` v4.2.1 - Archive handling
- `shelljs` v0.9.1 - Shell command execution

### Build Dependencies
- `esbuild` v0.25.0 - Code bundling for standalone executables
- `postject` v1.0.0-alpha.6 - SEA blob injection tool
- `rcedit` v3.1.0 - Windows executable metadata editing

### Cross-Platform Support
- Windows x64
- Linux x64
- macOS x64

### Standalone Executable Support
- Single Executable Application (SEA) build system using Node.js experimental SEA feature
- Build command: `npm run build` creates platform-specific standalone executables
- Bundles all code and dependencies into a single executable file
- Config unpacker automatically extracts configuration at runtime
- No Node.js installation required for end users

## Architecture Improvements
- Simplified process management
- Unified console logging system
- Improved hot restart capability

## Known Limitations
- MixItUp mode supported but complicated to set up.
- Item cache persistence: stored in `./saved/` directory as `{seedName}{playerName}savedItems.json`
- Goal completion triggers client exit after 10-second delay
- Standalone executables require Node.js during build process
- SEA builds are platform-specific (Windows, Linux, macOS builds are separate)
